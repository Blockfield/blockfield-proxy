# Vendored from blockfield-server@399b45c21b33ba8ecd29cc1abd9d79001e21a7d3 scripts/deploy-webhooks.py (server#278: deploy history).
# Local differences, kept deliberately: APPS pins this repo's Dokploy app names, webhook secrets
# and the release-only :prod channel; LOGS is the deploy host's fixed path; docker() also
# translates timeouts to CalledProcessError (covered by tests/test_deploy_webhooks.py).
"""Deploy an exact release through the app's Dokploy webhook. Actions hold only webhook URLs, never a Dokploy API key.

The Dokploy webhook redeploys only the image configured in the app and answers before pulling. So every app is
configured once with its release-only channel tag ghcr.io/blockfield/<app>:prod: main builds keep their own tags
and only the Deploy workflow moves :prod, by digest
(`docker buildx imagetools create --tag <image>:prod <image>@sha256:<digest>`). deploy() points the channel at
the validated digest, calls the webhook and returns only when the Dokploy log shows the pull of that digest,
every running task of the swarm service runs it healthy and swarm has closed the update's monitor window.

    deploy-webhooks.py digest <app> <vX.Y.Z>   registry digest of a release image
    deploy-webhooks.py current <app>           digest of the running image (the exact rollback target)
    deploy-webhooks.py deploy <app> <digest>   <app>: server or proxy
    deploy-webhooks.py serves <app> <digest>   exit 0 when every running task was started from this digest

A finished rollout appends {surface, version, digest, previous_digest, ts, run} to the host's
deploy-history.jsonl under BLOCKFIELD_MINECRAFT_ROOT and pulls the previous digest,
so a rollback re-points to a warm image instead of pulling cold.
